The repo consists of various hits and trials to use pathway and create a basic RAG infrastructure


Current Success:
Directory ```current_work``` has 3 files
1) anothet_llama.py : server having VectorStoreServer listens at a local host and port
2) custom_llm_chat.py: custom llm chat which basically mimics LiteLLM 
3) new_retriver.py: VectorStoreClient , which gets the context and then uses customLLMchat to get the final value.


```data``` contains the data , feel free to add files of various formats and test it.
